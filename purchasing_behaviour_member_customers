/* Health and beauty are highly rated as well as yielding a high per unit profit surpassed only
by F&B. Yet,they are bought the least. It will be worthwhile to see how the sales can be increased
further in this category. It will be beneficial to check why customers rate this category high and 
what they consider is the pull factor for them and design a campaign accordingly to boost sales.Let 
us see how female members are purchasing */

/* Female members are buying more products in the categories of F&B, Home and sports. A curious case
here is the fact that the health and beauty segment despite having the highest rating and lowest 
avg price still sees the lowest amount bought. This is despite the category being synonymous with female
members. There can be a number of reasons like 
1.The offerings are limited compared to other stores
2.Lack of awareness of the products within the product line
3.Myriad other factors like store placement, perception of low pricing etc.
4.Predominant stocking of male beauty products over female products
The store should investigate this and try to increase sales of the category */

/* Male members are buying Health &Beauty, Electronic accessories, F&B.It is possible that the stores
are stocking male beauty products to a larger extent than female beauty products.This possibly 
explains the health/beauty category being the most bought category amongst male members than female mebers.
The stores should also explore increasing their sales of health/beauty products amongst the female members*/
