categories(electronics,F&B,Health&Beauty). The total quantities bought by both these customer categories
do not differ by much either*/

/* In half of the categories member categories have rated their purchases lower than normal customers*/

/* In light of the above observations some questions to answer:
 1. Is the store deriving any benefit from its member category customers? If the intent is to drive more
    purchases through membership then it appears that the store is not benefitting from the program as 
    sales between both customer categories are more or less the same.
 2. Why are the member category customers rating products lower than normal category customers? Member
    customers have taken the membership as they see value in it. The store can benefit by surveying
    and finding out what these customers are looking for in their purchases. */
