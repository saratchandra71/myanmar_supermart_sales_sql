/* Compared with sales by orders, we can see that per order the categories of sports are seeing
   more quantity of items being bought compared to fashion category 
   Why is this? Can this be due to the pricing of the items? Nature of items? */

# Avg unit pricing per product category

/* The pricing vs quantity comparison shows that price is not the only deciding factor for customers
 when they buy the items. It could come down to the fact of necessity. Products belonging to the
 categories of Fashion, Sports,health,home can be seen as non-essential. Food and beverages are 
 essential in nature and are the second highest. Electronic accessories are non-essential in nature
 but due to the low pricing are bought in more quantity by the customers. What about quality?*/

 # Comparison based on ratings,price and quantity
 select product_line,

        round(avg(unit_price)) as avg_price,
        round(avg(rating),1) as avg_rating

/* Assuming rating is indicative of product quality, we can see that health and fashion rated at 7
are the least bought items.Customers value the items they buy in this category as indicated by the 
rating,but are conscious of the essentiality of the product. Food&Beverages are highly rated and 
electronic accessories are not the highest rated items though bought the most.Customers are price-
sensitive in this particular category and the lower pricing is affecting their purchase
behaviour */
/* 1. Product categories of Health&beauty, Fashion accessories are rated high but are bought in lower
quantities indicating their non-essential nature. If the stores are to run any offers then, products
belonging to these categories will likely see more traction amongst customers. A small-scale testing
can be implemented in one store to see the effects.
   2. It is advisable to also watch out for competitor pricing and market context before attempting any 
such strategies */

# Product category profit margins
